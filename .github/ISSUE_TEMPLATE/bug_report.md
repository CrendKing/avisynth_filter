Answer:

<!--
You could enable logging and upload the log file to help diagnosis. Follow wiki https://github.com/CrendKing/avisynth_filter/wiki/How-to-enable-logging

You could upload screenshots if the issue is related to visual.

You could upload the video file if it is small enough, or you know how to cut and crop it. If you do, be sure to test the cut file before uploading.
